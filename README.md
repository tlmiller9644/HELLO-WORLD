# HELLO-WORLD
We are in a world that does not embrace those that do not conform to the "norm." Our school system creates a common core of set instruction that do not allow a custom made lesson plan for those that learn in their own unique way. It make it quite frustrating to students who cannot learn the same way as the common core requires.
